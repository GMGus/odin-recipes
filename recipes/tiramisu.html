<h3>Ingredients </h3>
<ul>
    6 large egg yolks

    ¾ cup white sugar
    
    ⅔ cup milk
    
    1 ¼ cups heavy cream
    
    ½ teaspoon vanilla extract
    
    1 pound mascarpone cheese, at room temperature
    
    ¼ cup strong brewed coffee, at room temperature
    
    2 tablespoons rum
    
    2 (3 ounce) packages ladyfinger cookies
    
    1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder


</ul>


<h5>Steps</h5>
<ol>
    
    Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a medium saucepan until well blended. Whisk in milk and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture comes to a boil.

    Boil gently for 1 minute, then remove from the heat and allow to cool slightly.
    
    Cover tightly and chill in the refrigerator for 1 hour.
    
    Beat cream and vanilla in a medium bowl with an electric mixer until stiff peaks form.
    
    Remove egg yolk mixture from the refrigerator; add mascarpone cheese and whisk until smooth.
    
    Combine coffee and rum in a small bowl. Split ladyfingers in half lengthwise and drizzle with the coffee mixture.
    
    Arrange 1/2 of the soaked ladyfingers in the bottom of a 7x11-inch dish. Spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the ladyfingers, then spread 1/2 of the whipped cream over top. Repeat layers once more. Sprinkle cocoa powder over top.
    
    Cover and refrigerate until set, 4 to 6 hours.
